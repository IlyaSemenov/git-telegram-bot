# GitHub-Telegram Bot

A serverless bot that delivers GitHub webhook events to Telegram groups.

> This project was almost completely generated by AI ([Aider](https://aider.chat/) + Claude Sonnet 3.7). It's an alternative to [notifine](https://github.com/mhkafadar/notifine) which is developed very slowly and lacked important features that I needed: notifications on GitHub workflow runs, and branch filtering.

## Features

- Receive GitHub webhook events and forward them to Telegram groups
- Support for multiple GitHub events:
  - Push events (with branch filtering)
  - Workflow run events
- Secure chat ID encryption
- Easy deployment to AWS Lambda
- Custom domain support

## How It Works

1. Add [@github_hook_bot](https://t.me/github_hook_bot) to your Telegram group
2. The bot provides a unique webhook URL for your GitHub repository
3. Add this URL to your GitHub repository's webhook settings
4. GitHub events are now delivered to your Telegram group
