# Git-Telegram Bot

A serverless bot that delivers GitHub and GitLab webhook events to Telegram groups.

> This project was almost completely generated by AI ([Aider](https://aider.chat/) + Claude Sonnet 3.7). It's an alternative to [notifine](https://github.com/mhkafadar/notifine) which is developed very slowly and lacked important features that I needed: notifications on GitHub/GitLab workflow runs, and branch filtering.

## Features

- Receive GitHub and GitLab webhook events and forward them to Telegram groups
- Support for multiple events:
  - Push events (with branch filtering)
  - GitHub workflow run events
  - GitLab pipeline events
  - GitLab merge request events
- Secure chat ID encryption
- Easy deployment to AWS Lambda
- Custom domain support

## How It Works

1. Add [@GitPusherBot](https://t.me/GitPusherBot) to your Telegram group
2. Use `/github` or `/gitlab` commands to get a unique webhook URL for your repository
3. Add this URL to your GitHub/GitLab repository's webhook settings
4. Events are now delivered to your Telegram group
